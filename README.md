# aicli

aicli is a command line interface for AI chatbots. Currently only OpenAI is supported. Think of it like ChatGPT, but in your terminal instead of in the browser. You need an OpenAI API key to use it.

I threw this together so that I could access GPT-4 and pay only for my usage without paying $20/month flat rate for access to the web version. Also I tend to live in the terminal, so this is more convenient than tracking down a browser tab, logging in, etc.

## Features

- Resettable message history
- Saves input history, standard readline support (reverse search, up and down, beginning and end of line, etc).
- Can choose temperature and model with command line arguments

## Future 

- Send whole files
- Write conversation, or single response to file
- Load old conversation from file
- functions
- other OpenAI features?
- I dunno... open an issue if something interests you.
